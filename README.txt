Gapfill question type for Moodle 

Version 1.1 includes a count of correct answers and clears incorrect responses in interactive mode

A simpler Cloze question type that only supports fill the the blank type questions. 
Teacher can define the question with square braces to define the missing words. For example
The [cat] sat on the [mat]. Alternative delimiting characters can be defined during question edit
for example The #cat# sat on the #mat# can be valid.

If the dropdown or dragdrop options are set in the question edit form, it can display a shuffled selection of 
correct and wrong aanswers. These can then can be selected via dropddropdown lists or javascript powered drag and 
drop functionality.
